            <h3>About the image</h3>
            <p>This letter from Paul Siple to Mr. Behrend informs us of his journey to Antarctica.
                We learn that they traveled to a volcano by Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd
                Land. We also learn more about who all went on this trip with Mr. Siple. This
                includes Alton Wade, Geologist, Stevenson Corey, Olin Stan-cliff, and drivers and
                assistants. We also learned that Mr. Behrend also lent him money and tools for the
                expedition such as a sextant described in the letter. </p>
