                <li class="lih2">Dear Mr. Behrend,</li>
            
                <li class="li"><span class="paragraph"></span>It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of
                    friendship. This rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out
                    from the base of an extinct valcano, <div class="dropdown"><span title="ljbadjhv adjh">Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd Land,
                        Antartica</span><div class="dropdown-content"><p>content</p></div></div>. </li>
                
                <li class="li"><span class="paragraph"></span>The land was first discovered from the air by <span>Admiral Byrd</span> in 1929,
                    but it was first visited by our party travel-ing by dog team during October -
                    December, was composed of four men -<span> Alton Wade, Geologist,</span> <span>Stevenson Corey</span> and <span>Olin
                    Stan-cliff</span>, drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist </li>
                
                <li class="li"><span class="paragraph"></span>The valcano was at the extreme trun-ing point of our travels, about
                    three hun-dred miles from little america. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near
                    the point that blew almost continuosly for three miles an hour, and often of
                    hurrican velocity completely flattening our tent. </li>
                
                <li class="li"><span class="paragraph"></span>The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the
                    hundreds of weary, uncharted miles, and I returned it to you with deepest
                    appreciation and with it a place of Antarctic contintent it-self. </li>
