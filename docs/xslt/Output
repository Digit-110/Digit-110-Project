            Dear Mr. Behrend,
            
            <p><span class="paragraph"></span>1 It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of
               friendship. This rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out
               from the base of an extinct valcano, Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd Land,
               Antartica. </p>
            
            <p><span class="paragraph"></span>2 The land was first discovered from the air by Admiral Byrd in 1929,
               but it was first visited by our party travel-ing by dog team during October -
               December, was composed of four men - Alton Wade, Geologist, Stevenson Corey and Olin
               Stan-cliff, drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist </p>
            
            <p><span class="paragraph"></span>3 The valcano was at the extreme trun-ing point of our travels, about
               three hun-dred miles from little america. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near
               the point that blew almost continuosly for three miles an hour, and often of
               hurrican velocity completely flattening our tent. </p>
            
            <p><span class="paragraph"></span>4 The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the
               hundreds of weary, uncharted miles, and I returned it to you with deepest
               appreciation and with it a place of Antarctic contintent it-self. </p>
            
            
            <p></p>
            
            <meta>With kindest regards,
            <meta><br>
            
            <meta>Sincerly yours,
            <meta><br>
