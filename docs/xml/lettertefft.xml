            <greeting>Dear Mr. Behrend,</greeting>
            <paragraph n="1"> It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of
                friendship. This rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out
                from the base of an extinct valcano, <location>Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd Land,</location>
                Antartica. </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="2"> The land was first discovered from the air by <person>Admiral Byrd</person><date> in 1929,</date>
                but it was first visited by our party travel-ing by dog team during October -
                December, was composed of four men - <teamMembers num="5"><person>Alton Wade, Geologist,</person><person>Stevenson Corey</person> and <person>Olin
                    Stan-cliff</person>, drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist</teamMembers> </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="3"> The valcano was at the extreme trun-ing point of our travels, <distance>about
                three hun-dred miles from little america</distance>. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near
                the point that blew almost continuosly for three miles an hour, and often of
                hurrican velocity completely flattening our tent. </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="4"> The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the
                hundreds of weary, uncharted miles, and I returned it to you with deepest
                appreciation and with it a place of <location>Antarctic contintent</location> it-self. </paragraph>
