            <greeting>Dear Mr. Behrend,</greeting>
            <paragraph n="1"> It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of
                friendship. This rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out
                from the base of an extinct valcano, Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd Land,
                Antartica. </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="2"> The land was first discovered from the air by Admiral Byrd in 1929,
                but it was first visited by our party travel-ing by dog team during October -
                December, was composed of four men - Alton Wade, Geologist, Stevenson Corey and Olin
                Stan-cliff, drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="3"> The valcano was at the extreme trun-ing point of our travels, about
                three hun-dred miles from little america. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near
                the point that blew almost continuosly for three miles an hour, and often of
                hurrican velocity completely flattening our tent. </paragraph>
            <paragraph n="4"> The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the
                hundreds of weary, uncharted miles, and I returned it to you with deepest
                appreciation and with it a place of Antarctic contintent it-self. </paragraph>
        </body>
        <closing line="1"> With kindest regards,</closing>
