        <greeting>Dear Mr. Behrend</greeting>
        <p n="1"> 
            It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of friendship.
            This rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out from the base
            of an extinct valcano, Mt. Raymound Foadick in the Marie Byrd Land, Antartica.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            The land was first discovered from the air by Admiral Byrd in 1929, but it
            was first visited by our party travel-ing by dog team during October - December, was
            composed of four men - Alton Wade, Geologist, Stevenson Corey and Olin Stan-cliff,
            drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist 
        </p>
        <p n="3"> 
            The valcano was at the extreme trun-ing point of our travels, about three
            hun-dred miles from little america. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near the point
            that blew almost continuosly for three miles an hour, and often of hurrican velocity
            completely flattening our tent. 
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the hundreds
            of weary, uncharted miles, and I returned it to you with deepest appreciation and with
            it a place of Antarctic contintent it-self.
        </p>
        <closing>
            With kindest regards,
            Sincerely yours,
        </closing>
